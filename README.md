**_“Importance of Dust Radiative Feedback on the Trans-Atlantic Evolution of the Saharan Air Layer”_**

The study investigates how dust–radiation interactions influence the long-range transport of the Saharan Air Layer (SAL) across the Atlantic. Using WRF-Chem, HYSPLIT, and trajectory-based diagnostics, we evaluate how radiative feedback affects:

- Trajectory distance and speed  

Our results show that **dust radiative feedback** changes the behavior of dust transport, in some cases allowing it to travel **farther** across the Atlantic.
